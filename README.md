# ðŸŽ‰Regional Statistical Analysis Visualization
Taking Photovoltaic Disaster Damage Assessment as an Example.
Areas are categorized into different damage levels based on the number of pits: green represents 0 pits, blue represents 1â€“2 pits, yellow represents 3â€“5 pits, and red represents more than 5 pits.
